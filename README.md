# Terraform Provider for strongDM

The strongDM provider is used to configure and manage your strongDM account. It
provides resources and datasources that allow you to:

* Register gateways
* Enroll databases and servers
* Grant access
* Create and suspend users
* Manage roles

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13+

## Versioning

strongDM uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We do not guarantee
compatibility between major versions. Be sure to use version constraints to pin
your dependency to the desired major version of the strongDM Terraform provider.

## Authentication

If you don't already have them you will need to generate a set of API keys,
instructions are here: [API
Credentials](https://www.strongdm.com/docs/admin-guide/api-credentials/)

### Environment Variables

You can provide your credentials via the SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY and
SDM_API_SECRET_KEY environment variables.

```sh
$ export SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY="<access-key>"
$ export SDM_API_SECRET_KEY="<secret-key>"
$ terraform plan
```

Provider statement
```hcl
provider "sdm" {}
```

### Direct

If it is not possible to use environment variables add the api keys directly to
the provider statement as so:

```hcl
provider "sdm" {
	api_access_key = "ACCESS_KEY"
	api_secret_key = "SECRET_KEY"
}
```

## Basic Example

Create a Gateway

```hcl
resource "sdm_node" "example_gateway" {
    gateway {
        name = "example gateway"
        listen_address = "localhost:5000"
        bind_address = "0.0.0.0:5000"
    }
}
```

```shell
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

## Running integration tests

_**Important:** These are integration tests. They will create and destroy real
resources in your account!_

First clone this repository.

In order to run the tests you must set these environment variables so that the
provider can authenticate:
```sh
$ export SDM_API_ACCESS_KEY="<access-key>"
$ export SDM_API_SECRET_KEY="<secret-key>"
```

From the cloned repo, run:
```sh
$ cd terraform-provider-sdm
$ TF_ACC=yes go test ./sdm -v -count=1 -mod=vendor
```

You must set `TF_ACC=yes` in order to run tests. IF `TF_ACC=yes` is not set all
tests will pass without any action.
